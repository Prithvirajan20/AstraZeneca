Prithvi's:

Initially i was trying to containerize this service and deploy into AWS cloud. I have installed jenkins and gitlab in my AWS EC2 instance.

Due to insufficient time, i have skipped those steps.


## Clean-me-up

### General instructions
* ☢️ Do NOT commit to the main branch ☢️
* Do not write personal identifiable information, such as your name, in the solution
* Create a new working branch for your solution

### Preconditions
* The application exposes a public REST end-point for sending emails
* The application acts like a facade towards a legacy email library located in module **clean-me-up-support**
* The current implementation is rather ugly
* The API contract has not yet been published so you don't need to be backwards compatible
* Application is located in module **clean-me-up-rest**
* Don't change the legacy module **clean-me-up-support**

### Assignment
* Refactor the code in module **clean-me-up-rest** as you wish
* When you are done you should be rather happy with the code when it comes to: maintenance, quality, structure, architecture, testing, validation etc
* If you left things behind - please note that down in a read-me file
* Create a pull request towards master when you are satisfied with your solution

Estimated time ~4 hours, but feel free to impress us. 

### Stretch goals
When implementing a service - there are lots of things to consider. Some of those are:
* DevOps
* Security
* Documentation
* Versioning
* Monitoring
* Logging
* CI / CD
* Configuration
* Data integrity
* Fault handling
